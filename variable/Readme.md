# JavaScript Variable Declarations: `let`, `const`, `var`, and Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

## Overview

In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. Each has its own scope, hoisting behavior, and use cases. Understanding these differences is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code.

## 1. `var`

- **Scope**:
  - `var` is function-scoped or globally-scoped.
  - If declared inside a function, it is accessible throughout the function.
  - If declared outside any function, it is accessible globally.

- **Hoisting**:
  - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope.
  - They are initialized with `undefined` until the line of code where they are defined is executed.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(x); // Logs: undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // Logs: 5
```

## 2. `let`

- **Scope**:
  - `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is defined (e.g., within `{}`).

- **Hoisting**:
  - Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized.
  - Accessing them before their declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

### Example:
```javascript
{
    let y = 10;
    console.log(y); // Logs: 10
}
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

## 3. `const`

- **Scope**:
  - `const` is also block-scoped like `let`.

- **Hoisting**:
  - Similar to `let`, `const` variables are hoisted but not initialized.
  - They must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned.

### Example:
```javascript
const z = 15;
console.log(z); // Logs: 15
z = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## 4. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

- **Definition**:
  - The TDZ refers to the time between the start of a block and the point where a variable is declared.
  - During this time, accessing the variable will result in a ReferenceError.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 5;
```

## Key Differences

- **Scope**:
  - `var`: Function or global scope.
  - `let` and `const`: Block scope.

- **Hoisting**:
  - `var`: Hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const`: Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ applies).

- **Reassignment**:
  - `var`: Can be reassigned.
  - `let`: Can be reassigned.
  - `const`: Cannot be reassigned.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`, as well as the concept of the Temporal Dead Zone, is essential for writing clean and effective JavaScript code. Use `let` and `const` for better scoping and to avoid issues related to hoisting.

This Markdown document summarizes the key points about variable declarations in JavaScript. You can use it as a reference for understanding how to properly use `let`, `const`, and `var`, along with the implications of the Temporal Dead Zone.

# JavaScript Variable Declarations: `var` vs `let` vs `const`

| Feature               | `var`                  | `let`                  | `const`                |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Scope**             | Function-scoped        | Block-scoped           | Block-scoped           |
| **Hoisting**          | Hoisted (initialized with `undefined`) | Hoisted (not initialized) | Hoisted (not initialized) |
| **Re-declaration**    | Allowed                | Not allowed            | Not allowed            |
| **Re-assignment**     | Allowed                | Allowed                | Not allowed            |
| **Temporal Dead Zone** | No                     | Yes                    | Yes                    |
| **Global Object Property** | Becomes property of `window` | Doesn't become property of `window` | Doesn't become property of `window` |
| **Initial Value**     | Optional               | Optional               | Required               |

## Examples

### 1. Scope Differences
```javascript
// var is function-scoped
function varTest() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2;  // Same variable!
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 2
}

// let/const are block-scoped
function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;  // Different variable
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 1
}
