Generators are special functions in JavaScript that can be paused and resumed during execution. They allow you to produce a sequence of values over time, rather than computing them all at once. Generators are defined using the function* syntax and use the yield keyword to produce values.

Key Points: 
function* Syntax: Generator functions are defined with function*.

yield Keyword: Pauses the generator and returns a value. Execution resumes from where it left off when the generator is called again.

Iterator Protocol: Generators implement the iterator protocol, meaning they can be iterated using for...of or manually with .next().

Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce values on-demand, making them memory-efficient for large or infinite sequences.

The .next() method is a key part of working with generators in JavaScript. It allows you to manually control the execution of a generator, pausing and resuming it at each yield statement. Letâ€™s dive into some examples to understand how .next() works.
